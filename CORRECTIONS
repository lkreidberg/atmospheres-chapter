"Even though H and He dominate the atmospheric composition, they only have collision-induced continuum opacity at infrared wavelengths, and the spectrum is instead dominated by the molecular and atomic species shown here." -- Morley, in Fig 5 caption


Condensates, from Sara:
Aerosols are normally considered to be small liquid or solid particles that exist below the saturation point of whatever the condensible material in the atmosphere is. They are small enough to have a small terminal velocity / long settling time; generally they have atmospheric lifetimes of days to weeks.  Not necessarily produced by condensation. Think of dust lofted up that can stay in the atmosphere.

A cloud is composed of relatively larger particles predominately composed of a condensate; they are typically termed “cloud elements” and, unlike aerosols, they have relatively short atmospheric lifetimes (from minutes to hours) because of their size. They exist above the saturation pressure of the condensate - so for Earth above 100% relative humidity with respect to water, same for Mars (and include CO2) or sulfuric acid for Venus. For example, Mars’ dust clouds are not actually true cloud! 

Hazes are aerosols that contain some condensates but exist below saturation. For Earth this is deliquesced water / concentrated solution drops. For Titan it is organic. For example salts in the atmosphere, they will take up water.
