"Don't you just hate it when you travel 1,200 light years to a planet scientists have assured you is "Earthlike," and you get there, and there's, like, NO ATMOSPHERE?!!" -- Martin BG, Potomac, MD

Atmosphere characterization has the potential to reveal the nature, origins, climate, and habitability of extrasolar planets.


History:
	sodium in 209, following not long after the discovery of the first transiting planet
	thermal emission 
	climate - Knutson Spitzer phase curves
	water with HST/WFC3

ideal objects:
	small bright stars - rprs is better; cite planet occurrence papers (Dressing, Howard, etc.)
	photon noise - give example with throughput

Techniques
----------
- transmission spectroscopy
- emission spectroscopy
- reflection spectroscopy
- eclipse mapping
- phase curves

- scaling relations?

Facilities
----------
- space based
	x Spitzer (thermal emission)
	x HST (H2O)
- ground-based
	x high res (Snellen et al.)
	x low res  (Bean, Desert)

Wavelengths:
------------
 - lyman-alpha: evaporation
 - sodium, potassium: upper atmosphere
 - molecules

\section{High Precision Measurements}
- systematics (divide-white, analytic models, 
- red noise (wavelets, gaussian process)
- noise floors
- limb darkening
- optimal extraction
- background stars
- nightside flux
- clouds
- star spots (HD 189733b)
- model degeneracies (Kevin's GJ 436c paper; absolute transit depth)
- photometry vs. spectroscopy
- retrieval
- model selection and priors; equilibrium chemistry
- dayside average (patchy clouds Line; T/P profile Kat Feng)
- seeing terminator in transmission - wide range of pressures and temperatures

Results
-------
- greatest hits:
	GJ 1214b - clouds
	HD 209458b -
	GJ 436b - hydrogen escape
	55 Cnc e - thermal emission
	WASP-43b - chemical abundances 
	HAT-P-7b - weather
	HAT-P-11b - water in a smaller planet 
	TRAPPIST-1b, Proxima b, 
- chemical abundances (C/O, metallicity)
- climate (inversions, albedo, heat circulation)
- aerosols
- demographics (Sing et al, Stevenson et al., Knutson?)

Future Prospects
----------------
 - JWST
 - TESS
 - ECHO, ARIEL
 - ground based high dispersion coupled with starlight suppresion
 - future prospects: larger sample, smaller planets, broader wavelength range
