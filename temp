 In this section we discuss observational highlights, with a focus on transmission and emission spectroscopy.  For more comprehensive reviews, see \cite{crossfield15} and \cite{deming17}. %Before diving into results, let us briefly set the stage with some expectations for what we might observe. 
 
 \subsection{Expectations}
-We know from the Solar System that atmospheric composition can vary widely from planet to planet. Even so, we can still make educated guesses about possible compositions based on the building blocks of planet formation.  Planets form in disks of gas and dust surrounding young stars.  The disk has similar composition to the host star: predominantly hydrogen and helium, with smaller amounts of metals (the most abundant being oxygen, carbon, and nitrogen; \citealt{anders89}).  We would therefore expect atmospheres to be made up of these elements.  A further requirement is that the atmosphere be composed of species that are in vapor form at planetary temperatures and pressures (so-called \hbindex{volatiles}).  Molecules that satisfy both criteria include H$_2$, He, H$_2$O, CO, CO$_2$, CH$_4$, NH$_3$, O$_2$, and N$_2$.  We note that in the nomenclature of planetary science, H$_2$ and He are referred to as \hbindex{gases}, and the other molecules are \hbindex{ices} \citep{depater15}.

-The most abundant molecules are not necessarily the easiest to detect in a planet's spectrum. Observability depends on both abundance \emph{and} absorption cross-section. Hydrogen and helium, though they are the dominant component by mass for giant planet atmospheres, are relatively weak absorbers. By contrast, water and other ices have large absorption cross sections thanks to millions of rotational and vibrational line transitions between the optical and the far-infrared \citep{tennyson12}.  Ices are thus expected to dominate planets' spectra.  In addition, there are a few trace species with very large cross sections (alkali metals, titanium and vanadium oxides) that may be seen \citep{seager00, fortney08}.

 \subsection{Detections of Atoms and Molecules}
 A major step in atmosphere characterization is simply detecting absorbing species. This was first achieved for the hot Jupiter HD 209458b with the detection of the sodium resonance doublet at 589 nm \citep{charbonneau02}. Since then, both sodium and potassium have been detected in a number of other hot Jupiters \citep[e.g.][]{sing11b, jensen11, nikolov14, fischer16}.
