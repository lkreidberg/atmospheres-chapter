\section{Introduction }
%"Don't you just hate it when you travel 1,200 light years to a planet scientists have assured you is "Earthlike," and you get there, and there's, like, NO ATMOSPHERE?!!" -- Martin BG, Potomac, MD



\section{Observing Techniques} 
In this chapter we will focus on exoplanet atmosphere characterization using the combined light from the planet and its host star. In contrast to direct imaging, which seeks to mask the stellar flux, the combined light approach capitalizes on the star as a constant reference point. As the planet moves through its orbit, it absorbs, re-emits, and reflects light from its host star. These planetary signals can be measured differentially relative to the baseline stellar flux.

\subsection{Transit Spectroscopy}
The most widely used combined-light technique is transmission spectroscopy. For this method, the planet is observed in transit as it passes in front of its host. The resulting time series of brightness measurements is known as the transit light curve. During the transit, the planet blocks a small fraction of the stellar flux equal to the sky-projected area of the planet relative to the area of the host star (as illustrated in Figure FIXME). We refer to this fraction as the \hbindex{transit depth}, $\delta = (R_p/R_s)^2$. 

The key idea behind transmission spectroscopy is that the apparent size of the planet is not actually a single value: rather, it depends on the wavelength of light used for the observation.  At wavelengths where the atmosphere is relatively more opaque due to absorption by atoms or molecules, the planet blocks slightly more stellar flux.  To measure these variations, the light curve is binned in wavelength into spectrophotometric channels, and the light curve from each channel is fit separately with a transit model (see section FIXME).  The measured transit depths as a function of wavelength constitute the \hbindex{transmission spectrum}, so named because it arises from the transmission of stellar flux through the planet's atmosphere.
 
Theoretical models for the transmission spectrum require radiative transfer calculation for light on the slant path through the atmosphere \citep{seager00}, a computationally intensive task. However, we can make a rough prediction of the size of features in the transmission spectrum based on the atmospheric \hbindex{scale height} $H$. The scale height is the change in altitude over which the pressure drops by a factor of $e$. Assuming hydrostatic equilibrium, 

\begin{equation}
H = \frac{K_bT_{eq}}{\mu g}
\end{equation}
where $K_b$ is the Boltzmann constant, $T_{eq}$ is the planet's \hbindex{equilibrium temperature}, $\mu$ is the mean molecular mass, and $g$ is the surface gravity (FIXME). 

The amplitude of spectral features in transmission is then:
\begin{eqnarray}
\delta_\lambda &=& \frac{(R_p + nH)^2}{R_s^2} - \frac{R_p^2}{R_s^2}\\
 & \approx & 2R_pH/R_s^2
\end{eqnarray} 
where $n$ is the number of scale heights crossed at wavelengths with high opacity (typically around two for cloud-free atmospheres, \cite{stevenson16}. The ideal candidates for transmission spectroscopy is a planet with high equilibrium temperature, a small host star, low surface gravity, and a low mean molecular mass atmosphere. Even for the best cases, the amplitude of spectral features is just $\delta_\lambda \sim0.1\%$ \citep[e.g. WASP 121-b;][]{evans16}. For Earth-like planets, the expected amplitude is two to three orders of magnitude smaller, depending on host star size. 

%It should be emphasized how miniscule these variations in transit depth are. Even for the best case scenario -- a hot, hydrogen-rich atmosphere with low surface gravity -- the amplitude of features is 

%Transmission spectrum measurements therefore require extraordinary care and investment of telescope resources, as discussed in FIXME.

\subsection{Occultation Spectroscopy}
A close cousin of the transit spectroscopy method is \hbindex{occultation spectroscopy}, which measures thermal emission and reflection from the planet. Rather than observing the planet during transit, it is observed at secondary eclipse, when it passes behind the host star. The eclipse provides a baseline measurement of the stellar flux alone. When the planet rotates back into view, any increase in brightness can be attributed to the planet's thermal emission and reflected light.

For the short-period planets that have been studied so far, the dominant source of thermal emission is re-radiation of incident stellar flux (rather than latent heat of formation, as seen for directly imaged planets). Thus the typical size of the emission signal can be predicted from the planet's equilibrium temperature:

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:fpfs}
\frac{F_p}{F_s} = \frac{B(\lambda, T_{eq})}{B(\lambda, T_s)}\left(\frac{R_p}{R_s}\right)^2
\end{equation}
where $F_p/F_s$ is the planet-to-star flux ratio, $B(\lambda, T)$ is the blackbody spectral radiance at temperature $T$, and $R_p/R_s$ is the planet-to-star radius ratio. Since the planet is cooler than the star, the flux ratio is larger at longer wavelengths. For example, the planet-to-star flux for the hot Jupiter HD 209458b is just 50 parts per million at 1 $\mu$m, but increases to over 1000 ppm at 4.5 $\mu$m \citep{line16}.

Equation \ref{eqn:fpfs} is a good first order approximation of the planet signal, but as with transmission spectroscopy, more complex features arise in the spectrum due to the atmosphere's changing opacity with wavelength. The emitted light comes from the photosphere of the planet, where the optical depth is of order unity.  As opacity increases, so does the altitude of the photosphere.  Therefore, since temperature changes with altitude, the observed atmosphere may be above or below $T_{eq}$, depending on the wavelength of the measurement and the altitude it probes. 

%A useful way to describe the temperature of the photosphere is the \hbindex{brightness temperature}: the temperature a blackbody needed to replicate the observed spectral intensity at a given wavelength.

At short wavelengths, reflected light from the planet may also be detectable. It is convenient to quantify the amount of reflected light in terms of a ``perfect" mirror: a flat, reflecting disk with the same cross-sectional area as the planet. The ratio of reflected light from the fully illuminated planet, relative to reflection by a perfect mirror, is the geometric albedo $A_g$. The total reflected light signal is

\begin{equation}
F_{reflect} = A_g(R_p/a)^2 \Phi(\alpha)
\end{equation}
where $a$ is the orbital separation and $\Phi(\alpha)$ is the phase function (the reflected light intensity at phase angle $\alpha$). The phase function depends on the scattering properties of the atmosphere, but analytic predictions are available for certain simplified models \citep[e.g.][]{madhu12}.  Reflected light is easiest to detect in the optical, where it dominates the thermal emission signal; however, the amplitude tends to be small \citep[typically less than 100 ppm][]{angerhausen15}.

\runinhead{Phase Curves}
Short-period planets that are tidally locked to their host stars pose a unique opportunity for thermal emission and reflected light measurements. The rotation period for these planets is known (equal to their orbital period), so over the course of one complete orbit all longitudes are visible in turn. A \hbindex{phase curve} observation consists of continuous time series photometry or spectroscopy of a planet over its orbit, using the stellar flux at secondary eclipse as a baseline. These observations are powerful in that they probe atmospheric physics and chemistry over a wider geographic region than transits or eclipses alone; however, they are challenging from a technical standpoint because they require long stares at a single object. %In principle it is possible to apply this technique to longer period planets that are not tidally locked; however, in addition to the feasibility challenge the interpretation is also problematic. 

\runinhead{Eclipse Mapping}
All of the occultation spectroscopy techniques described above rely on a hemisphere average of the planet's reflected or emitted light. To glean additional spatial information, one can use the \hbindex{eclipse mapping} method, which relies on precise observations of secondary eclipse ingress and egress.  During these intervals, the hemisphere of the planet is partially eclipsed by the star, allowing the observer to pinpoint the brightness of a smaller region and thus map the brightness distribution in detail \citep{rauscher07}. In particular, for planets with a nonzero impact parameter, the eclipse mapping technique is sensitive to changes in brightness with latitude (as higher latitudes are first to enter and exit eclipse). 
% This approach is based on the fact that planets are not uniformly bright. In the case of a hot gas giant, the hottest part of the atmosphere may be offset from the substellar point due to atmospheric circulation. For a terrestrial planet, continents and oceans with varying reflectivity may be present. 

\section{Observing Facilities}
Detecting the tiny signals from exoplanet atmospheres is a formidable challenge. Even for the most favorable systems, the amplitude of spectral features is of order a tenth of a percent \citep[e.g.][]{evans16}. Pushing to this level of precision requires many photons (and thus large telescopes) as well as a stable observing environment (ideally in space).  In this section, we summarize the observing facilities that are best suited to this task (current as of January 2017).

\subsection{Space-Based}
Observing exoplanets from space is advantageous in several ways. First, space telescopes are free from atmospheric turbulence that adds systematic noise to light curves (see Section FIXME for more on red noise). In addition, wavelength regions that are blocked by the Earth's atmosphere become accessible (e.g., ultra-violet and water absorption bands).  Space-based detectors can also be cooled to low temperatures, enabling longer wavelength observations than are possible from the ground.

\runinhead{Hubble Space Telescope}
The 2.7 m \emph{Hubble Space Telescope} (\HST) has two instruments widely used for atmosphere studies: the Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) and the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS). 

WFC3 is \HST's newest detector (installed in 2009) and succeeds NICMOS (the Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer). It provides near-infrared, low-resolution spectroscopy from $0.8 - 1.7$ $\mu$m, where water molecules have strong absorption features (FIXME ref).  As of 2017, WFC3 measurements are the gold standard in atmosphere characterization: they are photon-limited, highly repeatable, and precise \citep[e.g.][]{deming13, kreidberg14a}. The best achieved precision to date is 15 ppm on the eclipse depths for HD 209458b at a resolution $R\sim 30$ \citep{line16}. FIXME NICMOS?
%The WFC3 detector is easier set relative to past results from NICMOS, which have been frequently debated in the literature \citep{gibson11}.

The other \HST\ instrument frequently used for exoplanet observations is STIS, a UV/optical instrument sensitive to the wavelength range $0.1 - 1 \, \mu$m. This range covers absorption lines from atomic alkali metals (e.g., sodium, potassium, magnesium), as well as the Lyman-$\alpha$ transition of atomic hydrogen. 

%The biggest downside to using \HST\ for exoplanets is that it cannot perform continuous observations. The telescope orbits the Earth every 96 minutes, so for roughly half that time (during Earth occultation) observations are interrupted. 

\runinhead{Spitzer Space Telescope}
In addition to \HST, the other space-based observing facility is \Spitzer, an 85 cm telescope launched in 2003. \Spitzer\ provided infrared spectroscopy from 3 - 160 $\mu$m until 2009, when it ran out of coolant. Now operating in its Warm Mission, \Spitzer\ is currently capable of broadband photometry at 3.6 and 4.5 $\mu$m.  \Spitzer's unique strength is its long wavelength coverage, where planet-to-star flux ratios are higher. It is therefore often used for thermal emission measurements. \Spitzer\ also provides continuous observing capability thanks to its heliocentric orbit, and has led the way in observations of thermal phase curves \citep[e.g.][]{knutson07}. 

%Most exoplanet observations have taken place during the Warm Mission, since relatively few planets were known prior to 2009!

\subsection{Ground-Based}
The Earth's atmosphere is an impediment to measuring precise light curves because its transparency changes with time.  As a target moves through the sky, line-of-sight properties such as the airmass, precipitable water vapor, and cloud coverage will vary, introducing time-correlated red noise in the light curve that may be orders of magnitude larger than the signal from the planet. Despite this challenge, there are several inventive strategies that have made it possible to characterize exoplanet atmospheres from the ground. 

\runinhead{Photometry and Multi-Object Spectrographs}
One approach is to use comparison stars to correct for systematic trends in the target light curve. For photometry, this is a straightforward process: in addition to the target, several nearby stars are observed in the same field of view. The path of their flux traverses similar parts of the Earth's atmosphere, so their light curves exhibit close-to-identical systematic trends as the target. The target light curve can then be divided by the sum of the comparison star light curves to remove systematics.  The same principle applies to spectroscopic observations, but requires a wide slit ($>10''$) to avoid loss of light due to time variable seeing \citep{bean10}. Custom-made slit masks are available for several multi-object spectrographs, including Magellan/LDSS3c, Gemini/GMOS, Keck/MOSFIRE?, FIXME.

%The same principle applies to spectroscopic observations, but requires a more specialized approach.  Spectrographs usually image the target through a slit prior to dispersing the light, in order to block out contamination from the sky background and any nearby stars. However, the slits are typically narrower than the seeing disk of the target star, and some fraction of flux -- highly dependent on the seeing -- is outside the slit.  To avoid these slit losses, one can use a multi-object spectrograph with a custom-made mask that has wide slits ($>10''$), a technique developed by \cite{bean10}. This method produces close to space-telescope quality precision \citep[e.g.][]{}.  There are several multi-object spectrographs available with a custom slit mask option, including Magellan/LDSS3c, Gemini/GMOS, Keck/, FIXME.  

\runinhead{High Resolution Spectrographs}
Another creative ground-based technique uses high resolution spectroscopy to detect the planet's atmosphere.  The idea is that the planet spectrum is Doppler shifted due to its orbital motion, and thus separated in wavelength from both the stellar spectrum and telluric lines from the Earth's atmosphere. The planet spectrum can be cross-correlated with a template to reveal the atmospheric composition and orbital velocity \citep[e.g.][]{snellen10}.  This technique requires a high resolution spectrograph to separate individual spectral lines ($R \sim 10^5$) and high SNR spectra (FIXME: how high?), so is only possible with a few current facilities. The most widely used instrument is VLT/CRIRES (FIXME), and there have also been detections with Keck/NIRSPEC and HARPS \citep{lockwood14, martins15}. 

 %For reference, the hot Jupiter HD 209458b has an orbital velocity of $140\pm10$ km sec$^-1$ \citep{snellen10}, corresponding to a wavelength shift of $5\times10^{-4}\times \lambda$.  Such a shift is detectable 

%The strength of the planet's individual Doppler-shifted spectral lines is too weak to detect with current instrumentation. However, the spectrum can be cross-correlated with a template, thereby harnessing the power of many lines.  The correlation strength is highest when the template is Doppler shifted to the planet's rest frame and matches its chemical composition.


\section{Best Practices for Achieving Precise and Accurate Measurements}
The basic format for observing transiting planets is time series spectroscopy or photometry, with the goal of detecting small deviations in brightness over time due to the planet's orbital motion.  In this section we summarize a few good p and discuss sources of error (both astrophysical and instrumental).


\subsection{Observational Design}
Designing a successful observation is in some ways more of an art than a science -- no currently available instruments were built with transiting planets in mind, and the planet signal is often orders of magnitude smaller than the typical precision of the instrument (FIXME ref).  But there are a few general principles that can increase the probability of success, which we summarize here:

\begin{itemize}
\item{\emph{The more observations the better.}}
\item{\emph{Observe enough baseline.} All combined planet/star observations rely on differential brightness measurements -- i.e., the flux measured during transit or eclipse \emph{relative} to the brightness out of transit/eclipse. Based on photon noise alone, the minimum amount of time spent observing baseline should equal the transit/eclipse duration. For the case of short durations, one hour before and after the transit  allow }
\item{\emph{Avoid pushing the detector to its limit.} The best targets for atmosphere characterization orbit bright stars, and a common temptation is to lengthen exposure times to collect as many of those photons as possible. However, as the detector approaches saturation its behavior is harder to  }
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Data Reduction}

\subsection{Light Curve Fitting}
The reduced data consist of a time series of brightness measurements (either a ``white" light curve summed up over the entire bandpass, or spectroscopic light curves created by binning the spectrum into channels).  The most general model for the data is:

\begin{equation}
F(t) = S(t) \times T(t) \times E(t) \times \phi(t)
\end{equation}
where $S(t)$ is the systematics model (for signals that are not astrophysical; e.g., a linear trend with time), $T(t)$ is the transit model, $E(t)$ is the eclipse, and $\phi(t)$ is the phase variation from reflected and emitted light. In cases where only a transit or eclipse is observed, the phase variation can usually be neglected.

Transit and eclipse models both depend on the planet's orbital position as a function of time. This is the classic two-body problem, solved in any dynamics textbook \citep[e.g.][]{murray99}. In addition to the orbital solution, the transit model also requires the planet-to-star radius ratio $R_p/R_s$ and the stellar brightness profile. Due to limb darkening, the stellar disk is brighter at the center than at the edge, so the fraction of flux blocked by the planet depends on its exact position.  \cite{mandel02} and \cite{gimenez06} calculated analytic solutions for the transit light curve for a range of stellar brightness profiles,  which are implemented in a number of publicly available software packages including \texttt{JKTEBOP}, \texttt{TAP}, \texttt{ExoFast}, \texttt{PyTransit}, and \texttt{batman} \citep{southworth04, gazak12, eastman13, parviainen15, kreidberg15a}. 

%The physical parameters for the orbit are the period $P$, time of inferior conjunction $t_0$, orbital separation $a$, inclination $i$, eccentricity $e$.  The orbital solution can be obtained via Kepler's law \citep{murray99}.
The eclipse model is a more straightforward calculation: 
\begin{equation}
E(t) = 1 + F_p/F_s (1 - \alpha(t)) 
\end{equation}
where $F_p/F_s$ is the planet-to-star flux ratio and $\alpha(t)$ is the fraction of the planet disk eclipsed by the star (easily calculated from the overlapping area of two circles). This model assumes the brightness of the planet is constant, and neglects planetary limb darkening or other variation in temperature/reflectivity. In practice, these variations are only detectable for the highest precision light curves \citep{FIXME}. 

The planet's phase variation is typically fit using a sinusoid with period equal to the planet's orbital period, with the option of adding higher harmonics \citep[e.g.][]{knutson12, stevenson16}. Alternatively, one can fit an ``orange slice" model that assumes constant planet brightness over slices in longitude \citep{knutson07, cowan08}. 
%A third option is to create a physically motivated temperature map and calculate the \citep{zhang16}. 

\subsection{Estimating Parameter Uncertainties}
As for all measurements, correctly estimating the uncertainty on the planet spectrum is as important as the detection itself.  The best approach for determining the uncertainties depends primarily on whether the noise is correlated in time.  

In the case of uncorrelated noise (referred to as ``white" or ``Gaussian" noise), the uncertainties can be estimated with the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique, a Bayesian method that calculates the posterior probability distribution for the model parameters (see \citealt{sivia96} for a general overview of Bayesian methods and \citealt{ford05} for a specific application of MCMC to exoplanets). These fits can be computationally challenging, especially if there are many parameters with correlated uncertainties. Sophisticated MCMC methods have been developed to address this problem, including differential evolution MCMC \citep{braak06}, or affine-invariant sampling \citep{goodman10}, implemented in the Python package \texttt{emcee} \citep{foremanmackey13}.

Estimating uncertainties is more difficult in the presence of ``red", time-correlated noise. Red noise is easily identified by eye in the residuals of the light curve fit (see Figure FIXME). To quantitatively test for it, one can bin the data points in time. If the noise is white, the residuals are expected to decrease proportionally to the square root of the number of data points per bin. If the binned residuals are larger than expected, red noise is present and needs to be accounted for in the model fit.  A number of strategies have been developed to model red noise, including ``residual permutation bootstrap" (also known as ``prayer bead")  \citep{FIXME}, wavelet-based methods \citep{carter09}, and Gaussian processes \citep{rasmussen05}. Depending on the amplitude of the red noise, it can increase parameter uncertainties by factors of several, so it must be treated carefully.

\subsection{Sources of Error}

\runinhead{Photon Noise}
\hbindex{Photon noise} is the fundamental limit on the precision of a light curve. A star emits $N \pm \sqrt{N}$ photons per unit time. The $\sqrt{N}$ noise arises because each atom in the star emits a photon with some small probability, so the total number emitted per time interval follows a Poisson distribution. The relative error ($\sqrt{N}/N$) decreases as $N$ increases, so bright stars yield more precise light curves.  The best target systems for atmosphere characterization typically have H mag $< 10$ for infrared observations (or V $< 10$ for optical).  

The precision of a light curve is often quantified by how close it is to the photon-limited noise floor. Space-based observations often reach the photon limit \citep{sing11, kreidberg14a, ingalls16}, whereas ground-based observations are typically a factor of a few above it \citep[e.g.][]{bean13}.

\runinhead{Instrument Systematics}
The ideal instrument would record every incident photon. In reality, detectors have varying sensitivity 

Modern detectors have come a long way in achieving this goal, but they are not perfect. Here we summarize a few common effects that 

All the usual steps in data reduction must be taken: correcting for bias, dark current, and flatfielding. We focus here on specific noise sources that are not commonly taken into account, as they are only relevant for the special case of sub-percent precision spectrophotometry.

\begin{itemize}
\item{\emph{Charge trapping}.}
\item{\emph{Intrapixel effect.}}
\end{itemize}

\runinhead{Astrophysical Systematics}
There are also 
\begin{itemize}
\item{\emph{Stellar activity.} No star is a perfectly constant light source; over a stellar rotation period (typically weeks to months), star spots rotate in and out of view, and total spot coverage changes over longer timescales. The effect on the transit depth 

\citep{mccullough}.}
\item{\emph{Unocculted star spots.} In addition to the , star spots also }
\item{\emph{Background stars.} Roughly half of stars have one or more bound companions \citep{raghavan10}. If the companion flux is blended with that of the host star, it dilutes the planet signal. Transit and eclipse depths must be multiplied by a correction factor $1 + \beta(\lambda)$ where $\beta$ is the ratio of the background star to host star flux. High contrast imaging is often needed to detect close companions \citep[e.g.][]{bechter14}, and should be obtained for systems that are targets for atmosphere characterization.}
\item{\emph{Incorrect limb darkening.}}
\item{\emph{Planet .}}
\end{itemize}

\section{Major Results from Atmosphere Studies}

\subsection{Chemical Composition}
%One of the biggest strengths of atmosphere characterization is that it can reveal the planet's chemical composition. There are a few basic 
Before jumping into observational results, here is a brief summary of what chemical species we might expect to find.  We know from the planets of the Solar System that a wide range of chemical compositions are possible. However, we can make some educated guesses about basic atmospheric constituents based on the building blocks of planet formation.

Gas giants are expected to have atmospheres rich in hydrogen and helium accreted from the protoplanetary disk.  Some metals are accreted in gas form along with the H/He, and the atmosphere can be further metal-enriched by planetesimal impacts (FIXME). The most abundant metals are carbon and oxygen \citep{anders89}.  At the temperatures and pressures in planetary atmospheres, these elements combine into molecules: water (H$_2$O), carbon monoxide (CO), and carbon dioxide (CO$_2$).  (Molecular oxygen reacts quickly with neutral hydrogen and is not expected to be seen in abundance.) In addition to these very abundant molecules, a few trace species with large absorption cross-sections may also be seen. These include the alkali metals (particularly sodium, Na) and titanium and vanadium oxides (TiO and VO).  

The atmospheres of terrestrial planets are less predictable. Hydrogen and helium escape easily from small rocky worlds, so their atmospheres are more likely due to outgassing from the planet interior. Their compositions may evolve significantly due to geologic cycling -- or the presence of life (FIXME). 
%Observations of planet masses and radii have shown a turning point in bulk composition from gaseous to rocky at around 1.6 Earth radii \citep{weiss14, rogers15}. 
%These smaller rocky worlds are likely to have secondary atmospheres, outga

\runinhead{Detections}
Much of exoplanet atmosphere characterization to date has focused on basic inventory: what atoms and molecules are present?  Several absorbers have been unambiguously identified so far, including H$_2$O, CO, Na, FIXME. 

The most common is H$_2$O detections from \HST/WFC3.

There is also evidence for CO and CO$_2$ from \Spitzer\ photometry. However, the \Spitzer\ bandpasses are about $1\,\mu$m wide, and cover spectral features from multiple different absorbing species (CO, CO$_2$, H$_2$O). It is possible to

\subsection{Aerosols}
aerosols -- an umbrella term for clouds and hazes -- are ubiquitous in the Solar System and are proving to be common in exoplanets too. Evidence for aerosols shows up in both transmission and reflection spectra.

Transmission spectra are especially sensitive to the presence of clouds and hazes due to the slant viewing geometry during transit (FIXME: fig?) \citep{fortney05}. The optical path of photons is long, so even trace species have large optical depth relative to a face-on view.
